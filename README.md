Groovy Stack
============

A list of groovy tools for a consistent, productive stack.

This list should be an opinionated subset of the curated [awesome Groovy](https://github.com/kdabir/awesome-groovy) list, 
picking specific items from each category. As the list evolves, online examples for the tools, as well as a justification 
for their selection, will be provided.
